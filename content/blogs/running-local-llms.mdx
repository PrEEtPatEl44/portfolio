Over the past few months, I've been deep into running large language models locally on my own hardware. It started as curiosity — could I actually run something useful without relying on cloud APIs? Turns out, the answer is yes, but with caveats.

## Why Local?

The appeal is simple: privacy, no API costs, and the ability to experiment freely. When you're iterating on prompts or fine-tuning workflows, not having to worry about rate limits or per-token pricing is liberating.

## Hardware Reality Check

I'm running a desktop with 32GB RAM and an RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM). That's enough to run 7B–13B parameter models comfortably with quantization. Anything larger requires offloading layers to CPU, which tanks performance.

The key insight: **VRAM is the bottleneck**, not CPU or system RAM. A model that fits entirely in VRAM will run 5–10x faster than one that spills over.

## Quantization is Your Friend

Running a full-precision 13B model requires ~26GB of VRAM. With 4-bit quantization (GPTQ or GGUF), that drops to ~7GB. The quality loss is surprisingly minimal for most tasks — coding assistance, summarization, and general Q&A work great.

Tools like llama.cpp and ollama have made this incredibly accessible. A single command can download and run a quantized model.

## What Actually Works

For coding tasks, CodeLlama 13B quantized to 4-bit has been my daily driver. It handles autocomplete, refactoring suggestions, and explaining code well enough that I rarely reach for cloud APIs anymore.

For general conversation and writing, Mistral 7B punches way above its weight class. Fast inference and genuinely useful outputs.

## The Tradeoffs

Local models aren't replacing GPT-4 or Claude for complex reasoning tasks. They struggle with nuanced instructions, long-context problems, and tasks requiring broad world knowledge. But for focused, domain-specific work? They're more than good enough.

The ecosystem is moving fast. What required a PhD and a cluster two years ago now runs on a gaming PC. I'm excited to see where this goes.
